# Backend Read.me



# For Error Handling

The logs will be created in:

- backend/logs/combined.log - All logs
- backend/logs/error.log - Only errors
- backend/logs/process.log - Process steps and info
---------------------------
You'll see colored output in the terminal like:
------------------------
- 🔵 DEBUG (Cyan)
- ⚪ INFO (White)
- 🟡 WARN (Yellow)
- 🔴 ERROR (Red)
- 🟢 SUCCESS (Green)

Each request will have a unique requestId (like REQ-1699123456789) so you can track the entire workflow through the logs!
